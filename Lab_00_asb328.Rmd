## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} 
#echo=FALSE sets only the code chunk output to show
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# New header
```{r}
name <- "asbhalla"
noun <- "patchoulli"
color <- "sparkly purple"
```
<!-- to refer to objects in the code chunk in the text portion -->
Oh `r name`!


<!--use a backslash with two spaces for hard line break -->
The `r noun` is `r color`
